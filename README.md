## How The Application Works
- Main level of the game starts
- The player spawns in front of a lecturn that has a gun on it.
- Unable to teleport where the pyramids (targets) are located
- Shoot 3 of the 5 targets to unlock teleportation
- Reload if running low on ammo, there will be a 1.5 second delay and then the debugging UI will say "RELOADING" and a sound will play
- Once all targets are destroyed the WIN level is loaded in and the game is over.

## Requirements to Run
- Windows or Mac
- VR Headset
- Unreal Engine 5.3.2
